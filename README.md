# Parking-Lot-Management-System

## DESCRIPTION:
A vehicle parking app that helps users find and reserve parking spots in real time. Designed to reduce
parking stress and save time in busy areas. Features live spot availability, location-based search and offers a
seamless parking experience.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED:
- Frontend Design : HTML, CSS with Bootstrap, Jinja2 templating
- Backend Framework : Flask
- Database : SQLite3 with SQLAlchemy

- The core functionalities of the project include user registration and login, admin and user dashboards,
parking lot and spot management, and parking spot reservation and release.
- These are implemented using Flask Blueprints for separation of admin and user functionalities and Jinja2
for dynamic rendering of UI.
- Users can search for parking locations by name or pincode and book available spots (Spot assigned to user
based on chosen parking lot, user cannot choose the spot), and release the occupied spot.
- A summary and reservation history is maintained per user.
- Admin features include adding, editing and deleting unoccupied parking lots, viewing spot status in a
visual grid, access to list of registered users, and summary reports on revenue.
